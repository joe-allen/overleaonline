## ToDo:
- 'v-card--leader' should be 25% width and have less height.
- Tabindex on main nav `<span>` dropdown items. W/ aria-controls label.
- resize above 1024px when mobile menu open should close menu and show desktop nav.
- social icons
- main logo
- checkbox on form
- search
- parallax homepage
- on slider.twig add `element = function('is_front_page') ? a : span;`
- Slider 'left' arrow working?
- If you refresh 1/2 down the page, the hamburger is shown even if you scroll all the way to the top.

## Nice To Haves:
- main nav child items show before white background expands down. (stagger in instead)
## Questions:
- Ok to have "site by joeallen.dev"?
- Would it be better to change 'Govt Reps' to something more general? That way we can add anyone who wants their contact info on the site that may be helpful to get in touch w/?
## Comments:
## LAST LEFT OFF:
- Add taxonomy to 'Events' `https://github.com/johnbillion/extended-cpts/wiki/Registering-Post-Types`

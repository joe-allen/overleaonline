## Currently Working On:
- Start history template
## ToDo:
- 'v-card--leader' should be 25% width and have less height.
- Tabindex on main nav `<span>` dropdown items. W/ aria-controls label.
- resize above 1024px when mobile menu open should close menu and show desktop nav.
- social icons
- main logo
- checkbox on form (use accent-color)
- search
[x] - parallax homepage
- on slider.twig add `element = function('is_front_page') ? a : span;`
- Slider 'left' arrow working?
- If you refresh 1/2 down the page, the hamburger is shown even if you scroll all the way to the top.

----

- EVENTS https://dev.overleaonline.org/events/
  [x] - update so that it does not show past events
  [x] - updates so that it says 'Check back soon' if empty
	[x] - Move sponsors below content instead of sidebar

[x] - Board members, add position and email CTA https://dev.overleaonline.org/info/board/
## Nice To Haves:
- On the date_time-acf, add a textarea for things like "every other Saturday between July - Oct."
## Questions:
Need images for the following:
- Overview pages:
  -
- Do we need a dropdown for Events or should it go straight to the 'overview' page instead?
- Ok to have "site by joeallen.dev"?
- Would it be better to change 'Govt Reps' to something more general? That way we can add anyone who wants their contact info on the site that may be helpful to get in touch w/?
- The site that all of the Rec links link to is down https://dev.overleaonline.org/resources/recreation/
- Metrics for:
  - Current Newsletter's being emailed?
  - Current Analytics
  - Pagespeed Insights / Screaming Frog?

## Comments:
## LAST LEFT OFF:

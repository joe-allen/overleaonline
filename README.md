## Nice To Haves:
- On the date_time-acf, add a textarea for things like "every other Saturday between July - Oct."
## Questions:
Need images for the following:
- Overview pages:
  -
- Do we need a dropdown for Events or should it go straight to the 'overview' page instead?
- Ok to have "site by joeallen.dev"?
- Would it be better to change 'Govt Reps' to something more general? That way we can add anyone who wants their contact info on the site that may be helpful to get in touch w/?
- The site that all of the Rec links link to is down https://dev.overleaonline.org/resources/recreation/
- Metrics for:
  - Current Newsletter's being emailed?
  - Current Analytics
  - Pagespeed Insights / Screaming Frog?
- What Admins need to be ported?
- Is it okay have my website linked in the footer?
- Anything else in the footer needed? Privacy policy? Terms of Use? 501c3?
- Should "Membership" have more presence? (It's under "Info", "Get Involved" and can be a CTA on any page).

## Comments:
## LAST LEFT OFF:

Meeting w/ Board:


- Need help with content on the following (most of them are the intro  2/3 sentences):
  - https://localhost:3000/info/
  - https://localhost:3000/info/board-members/
	- https://localhost:3000/info/membership/
	- https://localhost:3000/information/news/
	- https://localhost:3000/events/farmers-market/
	- https://localhost:3000/resources/
	- https://localhost:3000/resources/health-hospital-services/
	- https://localhost:3000/resources/safety-services/
	- https://localhost:3000/resources/scouts/
	- https://localhost:3000/resources/seniors/

- Default / fallback image is the colorful overlea sign. Is this okay or should there be another default image for the site?
- What to do about sponsors (e.g. https://localhost:3000/events/artsfest/). Are they needed right now?
- Image of board member? Or anything that they want to use.
- I certainly dont mind helping with content entry, but I'd like to train someone on the CMS at some point.
